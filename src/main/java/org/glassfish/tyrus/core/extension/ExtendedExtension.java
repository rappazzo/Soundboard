/**
 * WebSocket {@link Extension}.
 * <p/>
 * Capable of parameters negotiation, incoming and outgoing frames processing.
 * <p/>
 * Extensions are ordered as they appear in handshake response headers, as per RFC 6455, chapter 9.1. It does not state
 * any ordering in regards of sender/receiver side and current implementation reflects that. See TODO below for possible
 * issue related to ordering.
 * <p/>
 * Let's say we have negotiated two extensions, ext1 and ext2 in this order without parameters, so handshake response
 * headers will be: "sec-websocket-extensions: ext1, ext2". Prefix "c_" means client side, prefix "s_" server side.
 * <pre>
 *   client -> server
 *
 *                +--------+   +--------+                  +--------+   +--------+
 *   client  >----| c_ext1 |-->| c_ext2 |--> [network] --> | s_ext1 |-->| s_ext2 |--> server
 *                +--------+   +--------+                  +--------+   +--------+
 *
 *   client <- server
 *
 *                +--------+   +--------+                  +--------+   +--------+
 *   client  <----| c_ext2 |<--| c_ext1 |<-- [network] <-- | s_ext2 |<--| s_ext1 |<-- server
 *                +--------+   +--------+                  +--------+   +--------+
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * Any exception thrown from processIncoming or processOutgoing will be logged. Rest of extension chain will be invoked
 * without any modifications done in "faulty" extension. {@link javax.websocket.OnError} won't be triggered. (this might change).
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <pre>TODO:
 * - naming.
 * - ordering - we might need to ensure that compression/decompression is invoked first when receiving and last when
 * sending message (to enable access to uncompressed data for other extensions).
 * - param negotiation.
 * - param validation.
 * - general validation - two extensions using same rsv bit cannot be "negotiated" for same session/connection.
 * - negotiation exception handling (onExtensionNegotiation)
 * </pre>
